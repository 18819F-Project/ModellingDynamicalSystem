# Modeling Dynamical Systems with Deep Neural Networks By Leveraging Quantum Compute

A repo dedicated to a project related to Quantum Computing Deep Learning methods for dynamic system modeling for Carnegie Mellon University's 18-819F (Introduction of Quantum Computing) Fall 2021 course. The Repo is broken down into branches corresponding to the Classical, Hybrid, and Quantum Implementations of a Deep Lagrangian Network; a Fully-Connected Deep Neural Network (FCN) designed to learn the Lagrangian Mechanics of some Dynamical System by learning its necessary Euler-Lagrangian Parameters. The Dynamical System of interest concerned in this research project is the ever-popular, textbook, Double Pendulum.
