# Pendulum Data Branch

This Branch of the Repo contains those files which pertain the data used for the developing each of the DNNs. The data are procedurally generated via random uniform smapling in generate_data.py. NOTE: Neither the training nor testing data '.npz' files are included here due to size constraints, but may be easily recreated on a local system by simply cloning this repo and executing 'generate_data.py' on one's own terminal.
